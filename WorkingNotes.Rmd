# What Do We Want?
* Tidy verse exports
* Scale/rank questions collapsed into data
* Informative headings (alt question text)
* Data to be of the right class!


# Test Data
Created a survey which has all question types (as of 13/04/18), routing, alt question text, and at least one section heading. This should cover all forms of bos export.

Survey: [https://edinburgh.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/bossier](https://edinburgh.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/bossier)

Export names always take the form of results-for-[survey title]-[year]-[month]-[day]-[time].[extension]

## Play data
```{r}
# bd is basic export with no customised options
bd <- haven::read_sav("TestData/results-for-bossier-2018-04-13-1152.sav") 

# cd is customised data - unique response numbers, alt question text, scale/rank data combined
cd <- haven::read_sav("TestData/results-for-bossier-2018-04-13-1259.sav")

lapply(bd,class)
lapply(cd,class)
```
